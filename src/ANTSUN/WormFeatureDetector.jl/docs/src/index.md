# `WormFeatureDetector.jl` Documentation

The `WormFeatureDetector.jl` package contains a collection of utilities for parameterizing frames in a freely-moving recording.
The parameters are intended to describe how similar different frames are from each other, which is used in the context of the ANTSUN
pipeline to determine which frames to register to each other.
